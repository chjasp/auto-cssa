Service Name: Firestore
Compliance Status: Non-Compliant
Assessment Date: 2024-06-09

Firestore provides a scalable NoSQL database for mobile, web, and server development. However, it currently lacks support for customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) as required by our organization's security policy. This poses a risk of non-compliance with data protection regulations. Alternative solutions or additional security measures should be explored to ensure data confidentiality and integrity.
